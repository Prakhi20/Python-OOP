It's the ability of an object to take on various forms, allowing different objects to respond differently to the same method call. Essentially, it lets you use the same interface for different types of objects, making your code more flexible and adaptable.\n",
        "   - Here's:\n",
        "       - **One Interface, Multiple Forms**:- Polymorphism provides a single, unified interface that can handle different objects or classes, even if they have different implementations.\n",
        "       - **Flexibility and extensibility**:- It enables you to add new classes to your system without modifying existing ones, enhancing the flexibility and extensibility of your code.\n",
        "       - **Example (Method Overriding)**:- Imagine a class called Animal with a method makeSound(). Then, you have Subclasses like Dog, Cat, and Pig, each inheriting Animal and providing their own unique implementation of makeSound() (e.g., Dog would bark, Cat would meow, and Pig would oink). This demonstrates how different objects (Dog, Cat, Pig) can respond differently to the same method call (make sound).\n",
